# Project Completed w/ Handlebars and original ORM and Hosted MySQL Database
* Burger themed project allowing users to input a burger type to eat
* Burger is stored in hosted MySQL Database 
* Handlebars dynamically renders html content derived from database
* Partials used to create burgers and buttons
* Once button is selected on burger to eat it moves to another table in the database
* Display is then changed to another section of webpage
* Finally users can select to poop and it deletes the burger input from the database
